    REQUIREMENTS
    ------------

        * PHP >= 5.2
        * SQLite native extension
        * (optional) PHP Imagick or PHP Imlib extension (it will make thumbnail generation faster)
       
        Note: this application will throw an error on Free.fr hosting service because their SQLite
        version is broken (see http://www.aduf.org/viewtopic.php?t=170585 for details).

    INSTALLATION
    ------------

        Just copy the file 'gallery.php' to 'index.php' at the root of your pictures directory.

        Make sure the script can write to the pictures cache directory ([root of gallery]/cache).
        
    TAGS IN COMMENTS
    ----------------
    
        Try tag:My_tag in an image comments, it will link to the "My_tag" pictures list.
        You can add your own tags, take a look at the example user_config.php

    THUMBNAILS
    ----------

        Some softwares or cameras can mess up with the EXIF thumbnails (eg. the thumbnail
        is correctly rotated, but not the picture).

        If so, I suggest you to run this little shell line in your photos directory:

        $ find . -iname *.jpg | xargs exiftran -gip

        (yeah it will be a bit slow with big pictures)

    CHANGING DATES
    -------------
    
        If your pictures dates are messed up but you have named your images like '2000-Me_on_beach.jpg'
        you can try some shell line like this one :
        
        for i in 20??-*.jpg; do DATE=`echo $i | sed -r 's/([0-9])-.*/\1/'`; touch -d "${DATE}-01-01 01:01:01" $i; done;
