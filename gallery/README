    REQUIREMENTS
    ------------

        * PHP >= 5.2.0
        * PDO::SQLite3 extension
        * (optional) PHP Imagick or PHP Imlib extension (it will make thumbnail generation faster)
        * GD (if Imagick and Imlib are not installed), used for thumbnail generation when there is no
          Exif thumbnail available

        Note: this application will throw an error on Free.fr hosting service because their SQLite
        version is broken (see http://www.aduf.org/viewtopic.php?t=170585 for details).

    INSTALLATION
    ------------

        Just copy the file 'gallery.php' to 'index.php' at the root of your pictures directory.

        Make sure the script can write to the pictures cache directory ([root of gallery]/cache).

    TAGGING, COMMENTING AND ORGANIZING YOUR PICTURES
    ------------------------------------------------

        Fotoo Gallery, as its name stand it, is just a gallery, aimed to photo galleries.
        It's using datas embedded in pictures (EXIF comments and IPTC tags) to generate its database.
        If you want to comment, tag and organize your pictures in albums/directories, you will
        have to use a software that stores comments and tags in the files, like jBrout for example,
        which is a very good software.

    TAGS IN COMMENTS
    ----------------

        Try tag:My_tag in an image comments, it will link to the "My_tag" pictures list.
        You can add your own tags, take a look at the example user_config.php

    THUMBNAILS
    ----------

        Some softwares or cameras can mess up with the EXIF thumbnails (eg. the thumbnail
        is correctly rotated, but not the picture).

        If so, I suggest you to run this little shell line in your photos directory:

        $ find . -iname *.jpg | xargs exiftran -gip

        (yeah it will be a bit slow with big pictures)

    MAXIMUM IMAGE SIZE
    ------------------

        A good thing would be to resize your pictures before uploading them,
        there is a parameter MAX_IMAGE_SIZE in user_config.php that defaults to 2048.
        If a picture is larger than this number, the gallery won't try to resize it,
        either to a small one or to a thumbnail. This is to avoid high server load.

        You can resize all pictures from a directory to a maximum width and height with
        this shell line:

        $ find . -name '*.jpg' -exec echo "{}" \; \
            -exec convert \-size 2048x2048 \-resize 2048x2048 {} {} \;

    CHANGING DATES
    --------------

        If your pictures dates are messed up but you have named your images like '2000-Me_on_beach.jpg'
        you can try some shell line like this one :

        for i in 20??-*.jpg; do DATE=`echo $i | sed -r 's/([0-9])-.*/\1/'`; touch -d "${DATE}-01-01 01:01:01" $i; done;
